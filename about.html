<h1>About Relaxed Dai’s: Relaxed Dai’s was started by myself, Dai Anderson in July of 2018. </h1>

<p>We are so busy working and taking care of our families that we hardly take time out for ourselves. That’s how I came up with the mobile spa idea. Instead of having a customer have to travel and leave the comfort of their home, we will bring the Relaxed Dai right to your door.  This is convenient for many reasons. If you're getting a massage for relaxation, the last thing we want you to have to do is drive after your session. You can continue your Relaxed Dai right away. </P>

<h1>About Swedish Massage:</h1>

<p>This massage technique consists of long strokes gentle to firm depending on your tolerance and comfort level. It is a superficial massage which means we stay on the surface of the skin. It is considered the most relaxing. </p>



<h2>About Deep Tissue Massage: </h2>

<p>This massage helps to work out knots and aches. This technique can cause a bit of discomfort and be a little painful. However it is very beneficial depending on your condition. Have you ever heard someone say “ that hurt so good?” That describes this message perfectly. </p>



<h2>About Hot Stone Massage: </h2>

<p>This massage increases the act of loosening up the muscles.  Stones are heated to a comfortable temperature and lightly pressed into the skin while gliding simultaneously. Once temperature of stone starts to drop, the stones are stationed of differnt sections on the area being massaged.  </p>



<h1>Who Shouldn't get a massage :If any of these pertain to you, PLEASE do NOT book a massage. Thank YOU!!</h1>
